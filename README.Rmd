# tutorial_6

In this week's tutorial we have a brief look at some multilevel models using R and the `lme4` package. We motivate the use of multilevel models with a couple of simple examples and look at how to work with the model objects. 


We use a couple of packages this week:

- lme4 for fitting models 
- DiagrammeR for making simple diagrams (full illustrative purposes only)

```{r, eval=F}

# Install the lme4 package

install.packages('lme4')
install.packages("DiagrammeR")

```
